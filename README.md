# Kotlin
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference.
Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the
Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

## Topics covered
* Common data types
* Working with functions
* Control flow structures
* Debugging kotlin code
